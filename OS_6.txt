What happens when the pc is turned on?

i. PC On

ii. CPU initializes itself and looks for a firmware program (BIOS) stored in
BIOS Chip (Basic input-output system chip is a ROM chip found on
mother board that allows to access & setup computer system at most
basic level.)

1. In modern PCs, CPU loads UEFI (Unified extensible firmware
interface)

iii. CPU runs the BIOS which tests and initializes system hardware. Bios
loads configuration settings. If something is not appropriate (like missing
RAM) error is thrown and boot process is stopped.
This is called POST (Power on self-test) process.
(UEFI can do a lot more than just initialize hardware; it’s really a tiny
operating system. For example, Intel CPUs have the Intel Management
Engine. This provides a variety of features, including powering Intel’s
Active Management Technology, which allows for remote management
of business PCs.)

iv. BIOS will handoff responsibility for booting your PC to your OS’s
bootloader.
1. BIOS looked at the MBR (master boot record), a special boot
sector at the beginning of a disk. The MBR contains code that
loads the rest of the operating system, known as a “bootloader.”
The BIOS executes the bootloader, which takes it from there and
begins booting the actual operating system—Windows or Linux,
for example.
In other words,
the BIOS or UEFI examines a storage device on your system to
look for a small program, either in the MBR or on an EFI system
partition, and runs it.

v. The bootloader is a small program that has the large task of booting the
rest of the operating system (Boots Kernel then, User Space). Windows
uses a bootloader named Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr.exe), most
Linux systems use GRUB, and Macs use something called boot.
